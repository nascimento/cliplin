# Cliplin - Spec Driven Development Framework... *with tools*

> **Describe the problem clearly, and half of it is already solved.**  
> — *Kidlin's Law*

**Cliplin** is a command-line tool that enables **Spec-Driven Development** in your projects, taking human-AI collaboration to the next level.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

**Spec-Driven Development** is a software development methodology where **specifications are the source of truth**, not code. It's similar to approaches like SpecKit, but taken to a practical operational level.

### The Problem It Solves

In modern enterprise environments, AI tools fail not because models are weak, but because:

- ❌ Context is implicit, fragmented, or inconsistent
- ❌ Technical decisions get lost in conversations or outdated documentation
- ❌ There's no single source of truth about what, how, and why to build
- ❌ AI lacks structured access to project decisions and rules

### The Solution: Specifications as Source of Truth

In Spec-Driven Development:

- ✅ **Specifications are versioned and live in the repository**
- ✅ **Code is an output of the system, not its source of truth**
- ✅ **AI only acts on well-defined specifications**
- ✅ **Every change is traceable to a specification**

---

## Cliplin: Spec-Driven Development for the AI Era

Cliplin is not just a CLI tool. It's a **complete operational framework** that implements Spec-Driven Development in real projects, with real teams and real constraints.

### The Four Pillars of Cliplin

Cliplin organizes specifications into four complementary pillars, each with a precise responsibility:

#### 1. 🎯 Business Features (.feature - Gherkin)
**Defines WHAT the system must do and WHY**

- Specifications written in Gherkin (Given-When-Then)
- Express business behavior and rules
- They are the **source of truth** of the system
- **Key principle**: If a feature doesn't exist, the functionality doesn't exist

#### 2. 🎨 UI Intent Specifications (YAML)
**Defines HOW the system expresses intent to users**

- Describe screens, components, roles, and responsibilities
- Focus on **intent**, not pixels
- Allow AI to generate UI code without guessing UX decisions

#### 3. ⚙️ TS4 - Technical Specifications (YAML)
**Defines HOW software must be implemented**

- Act as a **technical contract**
- Include: coding conventions, naming rules, validation strategies
- **Key principle**: Doesn't describe WHAT to build, defines HOW to build it correctly

#### 4. 📋 ADRs and Business Documentation (Markdown)
**Preserves WHY technical decisions were made**

- Architectural choices, trade-offs, constraints
- Prevents AI (and humans) from reopening closed decisions

## How Cliplin Works

### 1. Initialize Your Project

```bash
# Install Cliplin from GitHub (recommended)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Rodrigonavarro23/cliplin.git

# One-time execution without installing
uvx cliplin init --ai cursor
```

Cliplin automatically creates the directory structure and configures everything needed:

```
.
├── config.yaml        # Cliplin config (ai_tool, etc.)
├── docs/
│   ├── adrs/          # Architecture Decision Records
│   ├── business/      # Business documentation
│   ├── features/       # Feature files (Gherkin)
│   ├── ts4/           # Technical specifications
│   └── ui-intent/      # UI specifications
└── .cliplin/
    └── data/context/   # Context store (project context store)
```

**Note:** Cliplin tools (SPAs) are part of the Cliplin package installation, not your project directory.

### 2. Write Specifications

**Feature File** (`docs/features/authentication.feature`):
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want to log in
  So that I can access my account

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I have valid credentials
    When I enter my email and password
    Then I should be authenticated
    And I should be redirected to the dashboard
```

**TS4 File** (`docs/ts4/input-validation.ts4`):
```yaml
ts4: "1.0"
id: "input-validation"
title: "Input Validation"
summary: "Validate data at controllers; internal services assume validity"
rules:
  - "Avoid repeating validations in internal services"
  - "Provide clear errors with 4xx HTTP status codes"
code_refs:
  - "handlers/user.py"
  - "validators/*.py"
```

### 3. Index Context

```bash
# Index all specifications
cliplin reindex

# Index a specific type
cliplin reindex --type ts4

# Preview changes
cliplin reindex --dry-run
```

Cliplin uses the **Cliplin MCP** (context store) to semantically index and search all your specifications, enabling AI to access relevant context in real-time.

### 4. Generate ADR Prompts

For proprietary libraries and SDKs, generate structured prompts that guide AI to create technical ADRs:

```bash
# From a local repository
cliplin adr generate ./vendor/my-proprietary-sdk

# From a remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
cliplin adr generate https://github.com/company/proprietary-sdk
```

The command generates a structured prompt with step-by-step instructions for AI to analyze the repository and create a consistent, precise ADR following Cliplin framework standards.

### 5. Use Tools (SPAs)

Cliplin includes built-in Single Page Applications (SPAs) that you can open directly from the CLI:

```bash
# List available tools
cliplin tool --list

# Open a tool
cliplin tool ui-intent
```

**Note:** Tools are part of the Cliplin package installation, not your project. They are provided by Cliplin and available in any project where Cliplin is installed.

### 6. Work with AI

With Cliplin configured, you can tell your AI assistant:

> "Implement the authentication feature"

And the AI will:
1. ✅ Automatically load context from the Cliplin MCP server (context store)
2. ✅ Read the feature file and related specifications
3. ✅ Apply technical rules defined in TS4
4. ✅ Respect architectural decisions in ADRs
5. ✅ Generate code aligned with your specifications

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher (Python 3.11 may have compatibility issues with the context store backend on Windows)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Astral UV) — recommended for installation from GitHub: `uv tool install git+https://github.com/Rodrigonavarro23/cliplin.git`
- A compatible AI assistant (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.)

### Windows-Specific Requirements

If you're installing Cliplin on Windows, you'll need:

1. **Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools** (Required for the context store backend dependency `hnswlib`)
   - Download and install from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   - Requires Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater
   - Without this, you'll see an error: `error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required`
   - **Important**: Install this BEFORE installing Cliplin

2. **Python Version Compatibility**
   - Recommended: Python 3.10 (most stable with the context store backend on Windows)
   - Python 3.11 may have compatibility issues with the context store backend
   - Verify your Python version: `python --version`

3. **Path Considerations**
   - Cliplin automatically handles Windows path compatibility
   - Use absolute paths when possible for better reliability
   - Ensure your project directory has write permissions

## Philosophy

> **Cliplin doesn't try to make AI smarter.  
> It makes the problem smaller, clearer, and executable.**

When problems are described correctly, both humans and AI perform better.

That's the essence of Cliplin.

## Ready to Get Started?

### Installation

#### For Windows Users

**Step 1: Install Prerequisites**

1. **Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools** (if not already installed):
   - Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   - Run the installer and select "C++ build tools"
   - This is required for the context store backend's `hnswlib` dependency

2. **Verify Python Installation**:
   ```powershell
   python --version
   # Should show Python 3.10.x (3.11 may have issues)
   ```

3. **Install uv** (if not already installed):
   ```powershell
   # With pip
   pip install uv
   
   # Or with PowerShell (recommended)
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

**Step 2: Install Cliplin**

Choose one of the installation methods below (same as other platforms).

#### Installation Methods

**Recommended: Install from GitHub with uv**

This is the default way to get Cliplin. It always installs the latest version from the repository.

```bash
# Install from main branch
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Rodrigonavarro23/cliplin.git

# Install from a specific branch (optional)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Rodrigonavarro23/cliplin.git@main
```

**Alternative: Install from PyPI or local (when available)**

Use `uv tool install cliplin` only when the package is published on PyPI or you want to run a local/dev build (e.g. after cloning and `uv pip install -e .`). For most users, prefer the GitHub command above.

```bash
# From PyPI (when the package is published)
uv tool install cliplin
```

**Other options**

```bash
# With pip from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/Rodrigonavarro23/cliplin.git
```

**Development / local debugging**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rodrigonavarro23/cliplin.git
cd cliplin
uv pip install -e .
# or: pip install -e .
```

#### Windows Installation Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

1. **"Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required"**
   - Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools (see Step 1 above)
   - Restart your terminal/PowerShell after installation

2. **Encoding errors when creating templates**
   - Set environment variable: `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"` in PowerShell
   - Or ensure your system locale supports UTF-8

3. **Context store indexing fails**
   - Ensure you have write permissions in your project directory
   - Try running PowerShell/Command Prompt as Administrator
   - Check that the path length is reasonable (<260 characters recommended)

4. **Python version issues**
   - Use Python 3.10 if you encounter compatibility problems
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
   - Activate it: `.venv\Scripts\activate` (PowerShell) or `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` (CMD)

### Initialize Your Project

After installation, initialize Cliplin in your project:

```bash
cliplin init --ai cursor
```

### Configure Claude Desktop

If you're using Claude Desktop, Cliplin creates rule files in `.claude/rules/` and MCP config at project root in `.mcp.json`. To use these rules:

**Step 1: Load Instructions at the Start of Each Conversation**

At the beginning of each conversation in Claude Desktop, copy and paste the contents of `.claude/instructions.md` into the chat. This file contains all project rules consolidated in one place.

**Quick Steps:**
1. Open `.claude/instructions.md` in your editor
2. Copy the entire contents (Cmd/Ctrl + A, then Cmd/Ctrl + C)
3. Paste it into Claude Desktop at the start of your conversation
4. Claude will now follow all project rules and protocols

**Why This is Important:**
- Ensures Claude loads context from the Cliplin MCP server (context store) before any task
- Applies all technical rules and architectural constraints
- Prevents wasted tokens and misaligned code
- Maintains consistency with project specifications

**Alternative: Create a Claude Skill (Advanced)**

You can also create a Claude Skill from the `.claude/` directory for automatic rule loading:
1. Zip the `.claude/` directory (MCP config is at project root in `.mcp.json`, not inside `.claude/`)
2. In Claude Desktop: **Settings > Extensions**
3. Click "Advanced Settings" > "Extension Developer"
4. Click "Install Extension..." and select the ZIP file
5. Claude will automatically apply these rules in relevant contexts

**Cliplin doesn't replace engineers, tools, or processes.  
It replaces ambiguity.**
