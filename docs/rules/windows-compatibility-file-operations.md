title: "Windows Compatibility: File Operations and Encoding"
summary: "Critical rules for file operations, encoding handling, and path management to ensure cross-platform compatibility, especially for Windows environments."
---

# Rules

- |
  ALWAYS specify encoding explicitly for all file write operations:
  - Use `encoding="utf-8"` parameter in all `write_text()`, `write_bytes()`, and file write operations
  - Default encoding varies by platform (Windows may use cp1252 or other local encoding)
  - Example: `file_path.write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")` NOT `file_path.write_text(content)`
  - This applies to: text files, templates, configuration files, markdown, YAML, JSON, and any text-based files
- |
  ALWAYS specify encoding explicitly for all file read operations:
  - Use `encoding="utf-8"` parameter in all `read_text()` operations
  - Ensure consistency between read and write operations
  - Example: `file_path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")`
- |
  Path handling for cross-platform compatibility:
  - Use `pathlib.Path` objects instead of string paths when possible
  - Always resolve paths to absolute using `.resolve()` before passing to external libraries
  - Example: `absolute_path = db_path.parent.resolve()` before passing to ChromaDB
  - This is critical for Windows compatibility with libraries like ChromaDB that require absolute paths
- |
  Path operations for database and external services:
  - Convert `Path` objects to strings using `str(path)` when passing to external libraries
  - Ensure paths are absolute and resolved before database operations
  - Use `Path.resolve()` to normalize paths and handle Windows path quirks
  - Never rely on relative paths for persistent storage operations
- |
  Error handling for file operations:
  - Wrap file operations in try-except blocks with informative error messages
  - Include path information in error messages for debugging
  - Log the absolute path when file operations fail
  - Example:
    ```
    try:
        file_path.write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")
    except Exception as e:
        console.print(f"Error writing file: {e}")
        console.print(f"Path: {file_path.resolve()}")
        raise
    ```
- |
  Windows-specific considerations:
  - Windows may have issues with long paths (>260 characters) - use absolute resolved paths
  - Windows uses different line endings (CRLF vs LF) - Python handles this automatically with text mode and UTF-8
  - Windows may have permission issues with certain directories - ensure proper directory creation with `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`
  - Windows path separators are handled automatically by `pathlib.Path`, but always use forward slashes in string literals or `Path` objects
- |
  Template file creation:
  - ALL template generation functions MUST use `encoding="utf-8"` when writing files
  - This includes: README files, ADR files, configuration files, rule files, and any generated content
  - Templates often contain special characters, Unicode, and multilingual content
  - Encoding errors in templates cause silent failures or corrupted files
- |
  Database client initialization (ChromaDB, SQLite, etc.):
  - Always resolve database paths to absolute before passing to client
  - Use `path.resolve()` to handle Windows path normalization
  - Wrap client initialization in try-except with path logging
  - Example:
    ```
    absolute_path = db_path.parent.resolve()
    client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path=str(absolute_path))
    ```
- |
  Testing cross-platform compatibility:
  - Test file operations on Windows, macOS, and Linux if possible
  - Test with paths containing spaces, special characters, and non-ASCII characters
  - Test with long paths on Windows
  - Verify UTF-8 encoding preservation across platforms
- |
  Code review checklist:
  - [ ] All `write_text()` calls specify `encoding="utf-8"`
  - [ ] All `read_text()` calls specify `encoding="utf-8"`
  - [ ] All database/external library paths are resolved to absolute
  - [ ] Path objects converted to strings with `str()` for external libraries
  - [ ] Error handling includes path information in messages
  - [ ] Directory creation uses `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`
