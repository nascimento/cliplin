title: "Cliplin CLI Technical Stack"
summary: "Technical stack and package configuration for the Cliplin CLI tool, installable via uv."
---

# Rules

- CLI must be implemented in Python 3.10+ with type hints
- Package management must use `uv` (Astral UV) as the primary installer and dependency manager
- Project structure must follow Python packaging standards with `pyproject.toml` for uv compatibility
- CLI entry point must be accessible via `cliplin` command after installation
- All commands must use `typer` or `click` for CLI argument parsing and subcommands
- CLI must be executable as a module: `python -m cliplin` or standalone: `cliplin`
- CLI must validate Python version compatibility (>=3.10) before installation
- |
  Package dependencies must include:
  - Python >= 3.10
  - uv (Astral UV) >= 0.1.0
  - typer >= 0.9.0 (or click >= 8.0.0)
  - pyyaml >= 6.0
  - rich >= 13.0.0 (for terminal output formatting)
  - pydantic >= 2.0.0 (for configuration validation)
- |
  Project structure must include:
  - src/cliplin/__init__.py (main package)
  - src/cliplin/cli.py (CLI entry point and command registration)
  - pyproject.toml (package configuration for uv with PEP 621 format)
  - README.md (project documentation)
- |
  Package installation methods must support:
  - uv pip install: via `uv pip install cliplin` (requires uv in PATH)
  - uv tool install: via `uv tool install cliplin` or `uvx cliplin` for one-time execution
  - development install: via `uv pip install -e .` or `uv sync` if using uv project structure
- |
  pyproject.toml must:
  - Use PEP 621 standard for package metadata and dependencies
  - Define entry points in `[project.scripts]` with `cliplin = cliplin.cli:main`
  - Specify dependencies in `[project.dependencies]`
  - Specify Python version requirement as `requires-python = ">=3.10"`
  - Include build system `[build-system]` with `requires = ["hatchling"]` or compatible
- |
  CLI command organization must follow:
  - Each command in separate module under `src/cliplin/commands/`
  - Commands registered in `src/cliplin/cli.py` using `app.command(name="command")(command_function)`
  - Utility functions in `src/cliplin/utils/` for shared functionality
  - Commands should validate prerequisites early and provide clear error messages
- |
  Rich library usage rules:
  - Never concatenate Rich objects (Panel, Table) with strings using `+` operator
  - Use separate `console.print()` calls for Rich objects
  - Build text content as strings first, then pass to Rich constructors
  - Example: `console.print()` then `console.print(Panel.fit(text))` not `console.print("\n" + Panel.fit(text))`
- |
  Init and version control:
  - When running `cliplin init`, the CLI MUST ensure the `.cliplin` directory is ignored by Git.
  - If `.gitignore` exists in the project root, append `.cliplin` (or ensure a line containing `.cliplin` is present) if not already present; use UTF-8 encoding for read/write.
  - If `.gitignore` does not exist, create it at project root with a single line `.cliplin`.
  - Do not remove or reorder other lines in `.gitignore`; only add or ensure the `.cliplin` entry.
- |
  Template directory discovery:
  - Search in order: package_dir/template, project_root/template, cwd/template, ~/.cliplin/template
  - Template directory must contain required structure for project initialization
  - Template files are copied and adjusted based on AI tool selection
- |
  ChromaDB integration patterns:
  - Use `chromadb.PersistentClient` with path to `.cliplin/data/context/`
  - ALWAYS resolve paths to absolute using `.resolve()` before passing to ChromaDB (critical for Windows)
  - Initialize collections using `get_or_create_collection()` to avoid errors
  - Use file path (relative to project root) as document ID
  - Include metadata: file_path, type, collection for all indexed documents
  - Check for existing documents before adding to avoid duplicates
  - Wrap client initialization in try-except with path logging for debugging
- |
  File operations and encoding (CRITICAL for cross-platform compatibility):
  - ALWAYS specify `encoding="utf-8"` in ALL file write/read operations
  - This applies to: `write_text()`, `read_text()`, and any file I/O
  - Default encoding varies by platform (Windows uses cp1252, Linux/macOS use UTF-8)
  - See `docs/rules/windows-compatibility-file-operations.md` for detailed rules
- |
  Development and testing:
  - Use `uv pip install -e .` for development mode installation
  - Activate virtual environment before testing: `source .venv/bin/activate`
  - Reinstall after code changes: `uv pip install -e . --force-reinstall`
  - Test in isolated directories to avoid affecting main project
- |
  Error handling:
  - Validate Python version at CLI entry point (main callback)
  - Use `typer.Exit(code=1)` for error conditions
  - Use Rich console for formatted error messages
  - Provide clear, actionable error messages to users
