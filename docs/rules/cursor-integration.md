summary: "Cursor-specific config, rules location, and quirks so that Cliplin templates and MCP behavior work correctly in Cursor."

# Rules

- |
  Config and paths (Cursor-only):
  - **MCP config**: `.cursor/mcp.json`; key `mcpServers["cliplin-context"]`
  - **Rules**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (always-applied and conditional rules)
  - **Template generator**: `create_cursor_mcp_config(target_dir)` in `src/cliplin/utils/templates.py` writes `.cursor/mcp.json`
  - Cursor typically uses project root as cwd when mcp.json is in the project; the MCP server runs with that cwd
- |
  Cursor-specific MCP behavior (MUST):
  - Cursor may send GetInstructions after initialize; the Cliplin MCP server MUST expose `instructions` in the initialize response so Cursor receives server info (see ADR-004, docs/rules/system-modules.md)
  - Without instructions, Cursor can log "No server info found" or treat the server as misconfigured
- |
  When changing Cursor-only behavior:
  - Changes to Cursor rules (e.g. new .mdc in .cursor/rules/) or to the content generated for Cursor must stay consistent with docs/rules/ai-host-integration.md for the shared MCP command (same command/args as other hosts)
  - If adding Cursor-specific templates (e.g. new rule file), document the path and purpose in this rules file
