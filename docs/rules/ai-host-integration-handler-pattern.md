title: "AI Host Integration Handler Pattern (One Class per Host)"
summary: "Each integration with an AI host (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) is implemented as a class that fulfills a common protocol; the general entry function delegates to the registered handler for that host, avoiding if/elif branches that grow with every new integration."
---

# Rules

- |
  Pattern goal (MUST):
  - Avoid the function that creates per-AI-tool configuration (e.g. create_ai_tool_config) accumulating many if/elif branches per host.
  - One responsibility per host: each integration (Cursor, Claude Desktop, future hosts) is implemented in its own class that knows paths, files, and content specific to that host.
  - The entry function (create_ai_tool_config) only: (1) resolves the handler for the ai_tool from a registry, (2) calls a single method on the handler (e.g. apply(target_dir)). It must not contain conditional logic by host name.
- |
  Handler contract (protocol):
  - Define a Protocol (typing.Protocol) or ABC with at least:
    - Host identifier (id: str, e.g. "cursor", "claude-desktop").
    - Rules directory path (rules_dir: str) and, if applicable, MCP config file path for validation (mcp_config_path: str | None).
    - Method apply(target_dir: Path) -> None that runs all actions for that host: create directories, write MCP config, write rule files, and any extra files (e.g. instructions.md for Claude Desktop).
  - Each concrete implementation of the protocol encapsulates: MCP config creation, rule file paths, and writing each file using shared content (getters in templates or the same module) as appropriate for that host.
- |
  Integration registry (MUST):
  - Maintain a registry (dict or map) of ai_tool id -> handler instance. The create_ai_tool_config function obtains the handler by id and calls apply(target_dir).
  - Expose: (1) list of known ids (for init/validate and error messages), (2) get handler by id (for create_ai_tool_config and, if needed, for validate). Do not expose concrete implementations to commands; commands depend on the protocol and the registry.
- |
  Where the code lives:
  - Protocol and registry: in a dedicated module (e.g. src/cliplin/utils/ai_host_integrations/ with base.py or __init__.py that exports the protocol and the registry).
  - One class per file or per host in the same package (e.g. cursor.py, claude_desktop.py) that implement the protocol.
  - Reusable rule content (long strings for context.mdc, feature-processing, etc.) may remain in templates.py; handlers import and use those getters to avoid duplicating text. The MCP command (command/args) must be the same for all hosts; document in ai-host-integration.md and apply in each handler's create_mcp_config.
- |
  Adding a new host (MUST):
  - Create a new class that implements the handler protocol (same contract: id, rules_dir, mcp_config_path if applicable, apply(target_dir)).
  - Register the instance in the integration map (one line in the registry module or in __init__.py).
  - Optional: add a host-specific rules file in docs/rules/<host>-integration.md and reference it in docs/rules/ai-host-integration.md.
  - Do not change create_ai_tool_config logic beyond ensuring the new id is in the registry; all logic for the new host stays inside its class.
- |
  Consistency across hosts (MUST):
  - The MCP command (uv run cliplin mcp) and shared rules (context, feature-processing, context-protocol-loading, feature-first-flow) must stay aligned across hosts. When changing the MCP command or shared rule content, update all handlers that use it and comply with docs/rules/ai-host-integration.md (same command/args, update both generators or all handlers).
- |
  Validation and init:
  - validate may use the registry to: (1) know if ai_tool is known, (2) get mcp_config_path from the handler to check that the MCP file exists. init uses the list of known ids for the "Unknown AI tool" error message and calls create_ai_tool_config, which already delegates to the handler.
