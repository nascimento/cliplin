Feature: Cliplin CLI Tool
  As a developer
  I want to install and use the Cliplin CLI tool
  So that I can initialize Cliplin projects with proper configuration for AI-assisted development

  Background:
    Given the system has Python 3.10 or higher installed
    And the system has `uv` (Astral UV) installed and available in PATH

  Scenario: Install CLI tool via uv tool install
    Given I have `uv` installed and available in PATH
    When I run `uv tool install cliplin`
    Then the installation should complete successfully
    And the `cliplin` command should be available in PATH
    And I should be able to run `cliplin --version` successfully
    And I should be able to run `cliplin --help` successfully

  Scenario: Initialize a new Cliplin project with default AI tool
    Given I have the Cliplin CLI tool installed
    And I am in an empty directory or a new project directory
    When I run `cliplin init`
    Then the CLI should create configuration files in the current directory
    And the CLI should create the required Cliplin directory structure:
      | Directory | Purpose |
      | docs/adrs | Architecture Decision Records |
      | docs/business | Business documentation |
      | docs/features | Feature files (Gherkin) |
      | docs/rules | Technical specifications (rules files) |
      | docs/ui-intent | UI Intent specifications |
      | .cliplin/data/context | Context store (project context store) |
    And the CLI should initialize the context store at `.cliplin/data/context`
    And the CLI should create the required context store collections:
      | Collection Name | Purpose |
      | business-and-architecture | Stores ADRs and business documentation |
      | features | Stores feature files |
      | rules | Stores the project's technical rules |
      | uisi | Stores UI Intent YAML files |
    And the CLI should ensure `.cliplin` is listed in `.gitignore`
