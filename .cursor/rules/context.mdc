## MANDATORY: Load Context Before any interaction with the user

**CRITICAL RULE**: Before starting ANY planning, coding, or thinking task, you MUST:

1. **Load context from Cliplin MCP server**: Use the 'cliplin-context' MCP server (Cliplin context MCP server) as the source of truth
2. **Query relevant collections**: Use Cliplin MCP tools (e.g. chroma_query_documents) to query and load relevant context from the appropriate collections:
   - 'business-and-architecture' collection: ADRs and business documentation md files located at 'docs/adrs' and 'docs/business' folder
   - 'features' collection: .feature files located at 'docs/features' folder
   - 'tech-specs' collection: .ts4 files located at 'docs/ts4' folder
   - 'uisi' collection: .yaml files located at 'docs/ui-intent' folder
3. **Never proceed without context**: Do NOT start any task until you have queried and loaded the relevant context from the context store collections (via Cliplin MCP)
4. **Use semantic queries**: Query collections using semantic search based on the task domain, entities, and requirements to retrieve the most relevant context
   
## Context File Indexing Rules

### File Type to Collection Mapping

The following file types should be indexed into their respective collections (see confirmation rules below):
- `.md` files in `docs/adrs/` → `business-and-architecture` collection
- `.ts4` files in `docs/ts4/` → `tech-specs` collection
- `.md` files in `docs/business/` → `business-and-architecture` collection
- `.feature` files in `docs/features/` → `features` collection
- `.yaml` files in `docs/ui-intent/` → `uisi` collection

### Metadata Requirements

- When indexing documents, always include proper metadata as an array of objects with the following structure: `[{'file_path': 'relative/path/to/file', 'type': 'ts4|adr|project-doc|feature|ui-intent', 'collection': 'target-collection-name'}]`
- Each document in the documents array must have a corresponding metadata object in the metadatas array at the same index
- Use the file path (relative to project root) as the document ID when indexing (e.g., 'docs/ts4/ts4-project-structure.ts4')
- Before indexing a document, check if it already exists by querying the collection with the file path as ID using `chroma_get_documents` or `chroma_query_documents`. If it exists, use `chroma_update_documents` to update it instead of adding a duplicate

### Automatic Detection and User Confirmation

When any context file is created or modified, you MUST:

1. **Detect the change**: Identify when files are created or modified in the following directories:
   - `.ts4` files in `docs/ts4/` → target collection: `tech-specs`
   - `.md` files in `docs/adrs/` → target collection: `business-and-architecture`
   - `.md` files in `docs/business/` → target collection: `business-and-architecture`
   - `.feature` files in `docs/features/` → target collection: `features`
   - `.yaml` files in `docs/ui-intent/` → target collection: `uisi`

2. **Always ask for confirmation**: Before indexing or re-indexing, you MUST ask the user:
   - "He detectado cambios en [archivo]. ¿Deseas reindexar este archivo en la colección [nombre-colección] para mantener el contexto actualizado?"
   - Wait for explicit user confirmation (yes/no/confirm) before proceeding
   - If the user declines, do not index the file
   - If the user confirms, proceed with indexing

3. **Indexing process** (only after user confirmation):
   - **Preferred method**: Use the Cliplin CLI command `cliplin reindex <file-path>` which handles all the complexity automatically
   - **Alternative method** (if CLI not available): Use Cliplin MCP tools directly:
     * Check if the document already exists by querying the collection with the file path as ID using `chroma_get_documents` or `chroma_query_documents`
     * If it exists, use `chroma_update_documents` to update it
     * If it doesn't exist, use `chroma_add_documents` to add it
     * Always include proper metadata as an array of objects with the structure: `[{'file_path': 'relative/path/to/file', 'type': 'ts4|adr|project-doc|feature|ui-intent', 'collection': 'target-collection-name'}]`
     * Use the file path (relative to project root) as the document ID
     * Avoid duplicated files and outdated or deleted files in the collection

4. **Manual re-indexing requests**: When a user explicitly requests to reindex files (e.g., "reindexa los archivos en docs/business"), you should:
   - **Use the Cliplin CLI command**: Run `cliplin reindex` with appropriate options instead of manually using Cliplin MCP tools
   - For specific files: `cliplin reindex docs/path/to/file.md`
   - For directories: `cliplin reindex --directory docs/business`
   - For file types: `cliplin reindex --type ts4`
   - For preview: `cliplin reindex --dry-run`
   - For verbose output: `cliplin reindex --verbose`
   - The CLI command handles all the complexity of checking for existing documents, updating metadata, and managing collections
   - Only use Cliplin MCP tools directly if the CLI is not available or for specific advanced operations

5. **Automatic indexing workflow**:
   - When context files are created or modified, **prefer using the CLI command** for indexing:
     * Run `cliplin reindex <file-path>` for the specific file that was changed
     * Or run `cliplin reindex --directory <directory>` if multiple files in a directory were changed
   - The CLI ensures proper metadata, handles duplicates, and maintains consistency
   - Always ask for user confirmation before running reindex commands (unless in automated workflow)
   - Use `cliplin reindex --dry-run` first to show what would be indexed
